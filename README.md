## About Me

I am a highly motivated and analytical individual with a strong foundation in Computer Science, Data Science, and Economics. I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Engineering in Data Science at the University of Pennsylvania, expecting to graduate in December 2026[cite: 1]. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, with minors in Economics and Statistics & Data Science, from Haverford College in December 2025 (expected)[cite: 1].

My interests lie at the intersection of data-driven problem solving, software engineering, and quantitative analysis. I am passionate about leveraging technology to derive insights and build impactful applications.
